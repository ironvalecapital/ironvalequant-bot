  "tweet": "IronvaleQuant — Week Ahead (Feb 1 ’26)\nMacro state leans risk‑on but watch liquidity & earnings. Tech & defence are focus areas and emerging markets show momentum on softer USD. We look for stocks above key WMAs with volatility compression pointing to breakouts. (Not financial advice)",

    "1/ Key levels & signals: Trend is defined by price vs WMA34/89/200; near 33‑bar highs hints at breakout, near lows at breakdown. Tight ranges & VCP compression suggest expansion. Derivative thinking: slopes & momentum shifts drive direction.",
    "2/ Psychology & risk: Trade only when quality score meets threshold, limit trades per week, respect stop‑loss & cooldown. Distribution thinking: evaluate macro regimes & probabilities rather than single-point forecasts. No specific trades advised."
